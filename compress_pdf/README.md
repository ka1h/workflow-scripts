# Batch compress PDF
This experimental script uses ![Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/) and ![ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) to batch compress all PDFs in a given directory. Ghostscript converts all pages in the PDF to an image and ImageMagick puts them back together to an PDF.

## Usage
Just place the script in the directory containing the PDFs and run the script.
